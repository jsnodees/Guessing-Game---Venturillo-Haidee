This game is called the guessing game, so basically this is a simple server-client game using python.

For us to start, you need to have a python on your device, because this wouldn't run if you don not have a python.

If you already have a pyhton installed on your device, then you can now proceed to the next step.

2. Download the file from the github.
3. Open the downloaded file on the destination folder
4. Open or Extract the file.

After you opened or extracted it, you can now run the file on your preffered IDE. 
if you plan to open them on one device, you can do so by clicking the "Run python file on dedicated termuinal"
By choosing that, you can run both the game server and the client in one IDE.


How To Play:
1. Enter Your Name
2. Choose a difficulty level (a,b,c)
Basically, the difficulty level is on a(easy), b(medium), c(hard)
3. You can now enter your guess, depending on the range of your chosen difficulty.
4. Every input you gave is youre going to receive a feedback from the server.
5. You can keep on guessing, it doesnt matter how many tries. You just have to keep on guessing to finally guess the correct number.
