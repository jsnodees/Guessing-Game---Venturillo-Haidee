This game is called the guessing game, so basically this is a simple server-client game using python.

For us to start, you need to have a python on your device, because this wouldn't run if you don not have a python.

If you already have a pyhton installed on your device, then you can now proceed to the next step.

2. Download the file from the github.
3. Open the downloaded file on the destination folder
4. Open or Extract the file.

After you opened it, you can now run the file on your preffered IDE.
If you want to use them both on a one device, you can do so.

To do that, you can click the "Run python file in dedicated terminal"
By choosing that, you can now use them both on only in the IDEs terminal.
